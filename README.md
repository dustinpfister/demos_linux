# demos_linux

This repo is a collection of demos that have to do with using nodejs and common linux commands such as echo, ps, and so forth. Just a place to park some things that I work out to then write about on my site when it comes to my [linux collection of content](https://dustinpfister.github.io/categories/linux/) that I wish to grow and improve.
