# Demos_linux

This repository is a collection of demos that have to do with using common Linux commands such as echo, ps, bash, and so forth. Just a place to park some things that I work out to then write about on my site when it comes to my [linux collection of content](https://dustinpfister.github.io/categories/linux/) that I wish to grow and improve.

## Programing

Many of the the examples here have to do with programing, mostly it is high level programing in the form of writing basic bash scripts. However some examples might contain javaScript, and python source code examples. I have also touched base on writing some very basic hello world style C examples when it comes to low level programing.

### Bash Scripts

I am always looking for new things to write about as well as learn a thing or two about in the process. For the most part I prefer to stick to javaScript when it comes to programing, but for my collection of Linux posts I think it is best to go more in the direction of using bash scripts in place of javaScript files that I run with node. I do like node as a way to make scripts that have the potential to be more portable, however bash strikes me as a better alternative when it comes to writing scripts that are closely tied to a Linux system such as Raspberry PI OS.

### JavaScript, and Python

Although bash might be the best choice when it comes to high level programing in a Linux environment, bash does have some short comings that can be addresses with other high level languages. As Much as I do like bash, working with in node and python allows for the creation of scripts that are more portable across mutable operating systems. As such some of the scripts in my for post folders may contain python and JavaScript code examples on top of just bash.

### C and Linux gcc

At the time of this writing I only have one demo folder in which I am using the Linux gcc command to compile some basic c source code files into a binary. This is something that I may or may not expand on at some point, however it might be best to have a whole other demo or test like repository when it comes to really getting into learning more about the C programing language.
