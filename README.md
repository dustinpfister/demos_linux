# demos_linux

This repo is a collection of demos that have to do with using common linux commands such as echo, ps, bash, and so forth. Just a place to park some things that I work out to then write about on my site when it comes to my [linux collection of content](https://dustinpfister.github.io/categories/linux/) that I wish to grow and improve.

## Bash

I am always looking for new things to write abount as well as learn a thing or two about in the process. For the most part I prefer to stick to javaScript when it comes to programing, but for my collection of Linux posts I think it is best to go more in the direction of using bash scripts in place of javaScript files that I run with node. I do like node as a way to make scripts that have the potential to be more portable, however bash strikes me as a better alterative when it comes to writing scripts that are closely tied to a Linux system such as Raspberry PI OS.
