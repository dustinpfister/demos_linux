## 06/28/21 to 07/02/21 - More posts on commands

The focus for this week will be to just write a few quick posts on some additional basic linux commands that I have not got around to just yet. This means looking into what I have not wrote a post about in the main bin folder thus far. If I have wrote a post on the linux echo command then I should also write posts on commands like linux cp, linux date, and so forth. However this might be the last week for these kinds of posts as I need to find out what the long term direction is with this collection of content.

### x.1 - ( done 06/28/21 ) linux-top
* (done) this command is a must when it comes to checkout out what the current status is with cpu load per process.

### x.2 - ( done 06/29/21 ) linux-cp
* (done) at least one if not more demos on the cp command

### x.3 - ( done 06/30/21 ) linux-mkdir
* (done) an s1 one basic example of mkdir
* (done) an s2 example of mkdir -p
* (done) an s3 example on mkdir -m

### x.4 - ( done 07/01/21 ) linux-date
* (done) have an s1 just a basic use case example
* (done) have an s2 example on the format options
* (done) have a -d option example

### x.5 - ( for 07/02/21 ) linux-awk
* (done) start out with just a basic s1 type example of awk





## xx/xx/xx to xx/xx/xx - More posts on some basic commands

There is writing even more on various basic commands that I have not wrote posts on just yet.

### x.1 - linux-rm
* have a basic demo with no options
* have a rm -d demo
* have a rm -rd demo

### x.2 - linux-pwd
* basic s1 example of pwd
* s2 example can be using cd to change the pwd
* s3 section would have to be on getting pwd in nodejs, and python.





## xx/xx/xx to xx/xx/xx - More posts on raspberry pi os

I like raspberry pi boards, everything about them is just plain awesome. I wrote a few posts on raspberry pi os in general rather than various things that might be more or less the same on most Linux systems. However it might be a good idea to continue to expand this kind of sub collection of posts on things that might just be central to raspberry pi os.

### x.1 - linux-raspberry-pi-os-raspi-config

### x.2 - linux-raspberry-pi-os-create-new-user

### x.3 - linux-raspberry-pi-os-lxdepi-lxsession-autostart

### x.4 - linux-raspberry-pi-os-wifi

### x.5 - linux-raspberry-pi-os-
