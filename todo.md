# demos_linux todo list

## 06/28/21 to 07/02/21

The focus for this week will be to just write a few quick posts on some additional basic linux commands that I have not got around to just yet. This means looking into what I have not wrote a post about in the main bin folder thus far. If I have wrote a post on the linux echo command then I should also write posts on commands like linux cp, linux mv, and so forth. However this might be the last week for these kinds of posts as I need to find out what the long term direction is with this collection of content.

### x.1 - linux-top
* this command is a must when it comes to checkout out what the current status is with cpu load per process.

### x.2 - linux-cp
* one example

### x.3 - linux-awk
* just a basic example for now

### x.4 - linux-date
* just a basic use case example

### x.5 - linux-awk
* just start with a hello world of it
