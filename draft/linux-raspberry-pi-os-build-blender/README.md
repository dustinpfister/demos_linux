# linux-raspberry-pi-os-build-blender

The aim for this was to find out how to build blender from source code in raspberry pi os. Thus far I run into errors when trying to just call make from the command line for a 'generic distro' following the build instructrions on [wiki.blender.org](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Building_Blender/Linux/Generic_Distro).
