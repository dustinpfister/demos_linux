# linux-bash

This is some bash source code for a post on Linux Bash in general. This will be a quick simple collection of scripts for each of the features of bash, without getting to deep into detail as with other posts where I am doing so. This post will serve as a general post on bash in general then, and will link to other local posts of mine where doing so is called for. In addition all posts on Linux bash should also link back to the post.

This is not the post itself mind you, but it is the bash files that I am writing about on the post, along with just some quick notes on things that should be parked here, rather than on the blog post.
