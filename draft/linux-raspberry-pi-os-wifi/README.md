I should write a post that has to do with any and all problems with wifi when they come up

## the Problem with RP4 and noise and wifi channel 1

I had a problem connecting to my phone with my rpi4 that I did not have with my rip3. I found help with this here that oddly ennough seems to help.

It wuld seem that the problem had something to do with noice on channel 1. I tryed connecting to my phone, then turned the monitor off, I also placed the phone farther away from the monitor. When I turned the monitor back on I was connected to my phone.
