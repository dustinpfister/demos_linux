# linux-tr

The linux tr command is one option for translating and deleting characters from some standard input. It can be used as an alternative to the linux awk command for various things, but so far I think that awk might be the best choice for this sort of thing in general. Still the linux tr command works great for what it does and can be used with many other related commands like the cut command and so forth when piping something threw a few commands.
