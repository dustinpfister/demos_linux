# linux-folders-home

I think I will want to write a collection of posts on the various folders off from the root folder in a Linux system. With that said I am thinking that the home folder would be a good place to start. It turns out that there are a great number of things to write about when it comes to this topic when it comes to some bash scripts examples. For example there are simple things like knowing how to change the current working folder to the home location, as well as some more advanced topics like user command aliases.
