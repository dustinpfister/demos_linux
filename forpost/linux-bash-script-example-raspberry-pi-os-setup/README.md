# linux-raspberry-bash-script-example-raspberry-pi-os-setup

The idea that I have for this is to have a bash script that I can pull down and run for a fresh install of raspberry pi os to setup the state of the home folder, and preform any additional tasks that I would typically want to do when setting up a fresh sd card from one of the offical raspberry pi os images.
