## xx/xx/xx to xx/xx/xx - More posts on raspberry pi os

I like raspberry pi boards, everything about them is just plain awesome. I wrote a few posts on raspberry pi os in general rather than various things that might be more or less the same on most Linux systems. However it might be a good idea to continue to expand this kind of sub collection of posts on things that might just be central to raspberry pi os.

### x.1 - linux-raspberry-pi-os-upgrading
* write a post on upgrading raspberry pi os
* why to use sudo apt full-upgrade over sudo apt-get upgrade

Good link as to why

## xx/xx/xx to xx/xx/xx - A few bash scripts using git

The plan here is to write a few bash scripts that have to do with using git as a way to create a collection of text files, and to also tract changes in word count as the collection of text grows or changes.

## 06/28/21 to 07/02/21 - More posts on commands

The focus for this week will be to just write a few quick posts on some additional basic linux commands that I have not got around to just yet. This means looking into what I have not wrote a post about in the main bin folder thus far. If I have wrote a post on the linux echo command then I should also write posts on commands like linux cp, linux date, and so forth. However this might be the last week for these kinds of posts as I need to find out what the long term direction is with this collection of content.

### x.1 - ( done 06/28/21 ) linux-top
* (done) this command is a must when it comes to checkout out what the current status is with cpu load per process.

### x.2 - ( done 06/29/21 ) linux-cp
* (done) at least one if not more demos on the cp command

### x.3 - ( done 06/30/21 ) linux-mkdir
* (done) an s1 one basic example of mkdir
* (done) an s2 example of mkdir -p
* (done) an s3 example on mkdir -m

### x.4 - ( done 07/01/21 ) linux-date
* (done) have an s1 just a basic use case example
* (done) have an s2 example on the format options
* (done) have a -d option example

### x.5 - ( done 07/02/21 ) linux-awk
